### TODO

---

- [ ] run_script.py - Needs more work.  Currently can't handle mixed-dice pools (e.g. 3d4+6d10 ) in param list
- [ ] utilities.py - Thinking of putting the split results into a dictionary or list
- [ ] utilities.py - Make the pattern matching/split more robustly. Currently case-sensitive
- [ ] rpg_system.py - Build out additional systems
	- [ ] Shadow Run
	- [ ] GURPS
	- [ ] Cee-lo
	- [ ] Previous Versions of existing systems
- [ ] Refactor dice-pool into it's own file
- [ ] After refactoring a bit noticed tests only work when current path is in the python path
